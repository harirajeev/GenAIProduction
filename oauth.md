OAuth 2.0 Flows 
. 
. 
Authorization Code Flow: The most common OAuth flow. After user authentication, the client receives an authorization code and exchanges it for an access token and refresh token. 
Best practice for web apps, especially when combined with PKCE to enhance security. Perfect for protecting sensitive data while ensuring user authentication happens securely on the server-side.
 
Client Credentials Flow: Designed for single-page applications. The access token is returned directly to the client without an intermediate authorization code. 
Essential for server-to-server communication. However, always ensure secure storage of client credentials to avoid compromising access tokens.

Implicit Code Flow: Designed for single-page applications. The access token is returned directly to the client without an intermediate authorization code. 
While it’s a simpler approach, it’s now considered deprecated due to security vulnerabilities. If you’re working with SPAs, I’d recommend transitioning to the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE to mitigate risks.
 
Resource Owner Password Grant Flow: Allows users to provide their username and password directly to the client, which then exchanges them for an access token.
This flow should be used with caution. While simple, it directly exposes user credentials to the client, which violates security best practices. Modern apps should look to avoid this in favor of more secure alternatives.
TL;DR: Authorization Code Flow with PKCE is the gold standard for modern apps. The key to OAuth 2.0 is not just choosing the right flow but implementing it securely to protect user data and access tokens.
